\title{Secure SLAM: An Anomaly Detection Approach} % TODO: replace with your title

\begin{abstract}
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the problem of making a map of an unknown environment while keeping track of an agent within it \cite{Thrun2008}. While there are a number of techniques being developed to perform SLAM, threats from sensor spoofing such as \cite{kerns2014unmanned} gain prominence. In this work, we look at a technique to make SLAM approaches more secure by means of detecting anomalies in location data. 

To this end, we use a custom UAV to gather system information from the operating system and flight controller to build a composite technique to detect violations from SLAM-suggested paths. The system information include CPU, Memory Bandwidth, I/O operations and flight controller control parameters such as gain, throttle and servo parameters to characterize normal behavior. We then use learning-based classification techniques to flag violations from the planned trajectory.
