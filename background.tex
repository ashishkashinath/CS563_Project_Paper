\section{Background}
Control Systems which are Open-loop are rarely used today. Instead, what is popular today is known as Closed-loop systems which have a feedback element that is used to minimize the error between the desired mission and the actual mission being executed. This is necessary since it is impossible to perfectly model beforehand the vagaries of the external disturbances as well as the noise inherent in the system.

An example of a closed loop system is as shown below:
